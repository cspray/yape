## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you find a security vulnerability in code that I have created 
please **do not open a public issue** and instead contact me directly at [security@cspray.io](mailto:security@cspray.io).
This email is hosted on a service using end-to-end encryption and I will respond within 24 hours of receiving any email 
at this address. We will then discuss further on exactly what needs to be done to resolve the vulnerability to the satsifaction 
of all parties.
