    Yet Another PHP Enum (YAPE) is a PHP 7+ code generator designed to provide a type-safe, object-backed enum implementation.
    While there are many existing PHP enum implementations they almost all boil back to some scalar value in a constant
    and this isn't the type of enum provided by YAPE. The API for generated enums is inspired by Java and if you have worked
    with Java enums the objects provided by YAPE will feel familiar, if slightly more verbose in their implementation.

  <h2 class="subtitle is-size-3">The Enum is <em>your</em> code</h2>
  <p class="content">
    Although this library aims to reduce the amount of boilerplate and code generation you need to deal with to start
    using type-safe enums it is important to remember... <em>the Enum is <strong>YOUR</strong> code.</em> You should look
    at the code after it is generated and you should modify the code as your needs may change over time.
