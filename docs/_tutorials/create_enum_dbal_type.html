title: Creating an Enum DBAL Type

description: It is expected that you'll want to persist your enum to some storage solution. We provide support for creating Doctrine DBAL Types out-of-the-box and this will teach you how to use this functionality.

<p class="content">
  It is anticipated that a common use case for an Enum is to be used as a property on an entity or model that needs to
  be persisted to a database or some other data storage. To facilitate this YAPE provides a code generator to create a
  <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine</a> <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/2.9/reference/types.html#types">DBAL Type</a>.
  Generating a DBAL Type is simple and just requires executing a CLI command and providing <strong>the fully-qualified class name for the Type</strong>,
  <strong>the fully-qualified class name for the Enum</strong>, and <strong>the name of the DBAL Type</strong>. Please
  note that the Enum <em>must</em> already exist or an error will be thrown. If we were to create a DBAL Type for the
  four-sided compass <a href="/tutorial-create-enum">from creating an Enum tutorial</a> we'd execute a command similar to:
</p>
<pre class="content"><code class="language-shell">vendor/bin/yape create-enum-dbal-type YourNamespace\\Doctrine\\CompassType YourNamespace\\Enums\\Compass compass</code></pre>

<p class="content">
  If your DBAL Type was successfully created the path that it was stored in will be output otherwise an error message will
  be displayed indicating why your code could not be generated. By default the DBAL Type will be stored in <code>./src/Doctrine</code>
  but if this does not work for you the <code>--output-dir|-o</code> option allows you to change the directory, <em>under the current working directory</em>,
  that the code should be stored in.

  After code generation you should ensure that your Doctrine configuration has been updated to include the mapping for your
  new custom Type. The exact steps necessary will be dependent upon how you configure Doctrine and are outside the scope
  of this document. The <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/2.9/reference/types.html#custom-mapping-types">custom mapping section of DBAL Types</a>
  or framework-specific integration documentation should provide the appropriate information.
